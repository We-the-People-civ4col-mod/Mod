This leaderhead is an imported model from Poser. The body is the lowpoly version of the Maria model, the clothes are based on Native American V4 set made by renapd & thip. Therefore, while many modifications of the models and artwork were made by me, I take no credit for the 3D model.

This leaderhead uses the Boudica animations from Civ4 BtS. It's completely modular. All files in the zip-file are already put into the necessary folders, unzipping it directly in the main folder of Colonization should result into a working mod. The leaderhead has a polycount of about 11000 triangles.
