How to add names to the game

Names are now added by adding the TXT KEY and nothing else. There is no setup in the info xml files.

Keys follows the form:
- Description from civilization info
- The type of object to name
- A number to tell them apart (welll index)

Example:
- TXT_KEY_CIVILIZATION_ENGLAND
- CITY
- 0

Joined with _, it becomes TXT_KEY_CIVILIZATION_ENGLAND_CITY_0

No number is allowed to be missing. If a civ has the cities 0, 1, 3, 4 etc, then the DLL will notice 
that there is no 2 and will assume the list to only contain two names.

No translation needed of names unless the translation differs from English.
