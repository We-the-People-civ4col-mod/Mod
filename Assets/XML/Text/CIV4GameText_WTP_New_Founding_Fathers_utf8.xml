        <English>[H1]Carl Linnaeus[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived : [\BOLD]1707 - 1778[PARAGRAPH:2:1][BOLD]Background :[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Carl Linnaeus, the father of modern taxonomy, was a botanist, zoologist, taxonomist, and physician. He was born in Rashult in southern Sweden. His higher education was at Uppsala University. He began giving lectures in botany there in 1730.[NEWLINE][TAB]His manuscript on classifying plants was published as Systema Naturae (1735). It established binomial nomenclature in Latin as the world standard.[NEWLINE][TAB]He admired the child care practices of the Lapps. They had healthier babies than Europeans who employed wet nurses. He became a strong advocate of breast-feeding by mothers. His activism here likely played a role in his choice of the term Mammalia for our class of organisms.</English>

Gates' actions made him a national hero upon his return to England, something the Virginia Company badly needed due to their previous dip in investors.</English>

Using native sheep, he was able to select for large animals with long, lustrous wool.[NEWLINE][TAB]As more and more farmers followed his lead, farm animals increased dramatically in size and quality. In 1700, the average weight of a bull sold for slaughter was 370 pounds (168 kg). By 1786, that weight had more than doubled to 840 pounds (381 kg).[NEWLINE][TAB]Selective breeding inspired Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection. In "On the Origin of Species" Darwin cited Bakewell's work.</English>
