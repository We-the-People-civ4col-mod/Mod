The charged particles originate in the magnetosphere and solar wind and are directed by the Earth's magnetic field into the atmosphere. In northern latitudes, the effect is known as the aurora borealis. Its southern counterpart, the aurora australis, changes simultaneously with changes in the northern auroral zone and is visible from high southern latitudes in Antarctica, South America, New Zealand, and Australia.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Victoria Falls or Mosi-oa-Tunya is a waterfall located in southern Africa on the Zambezi River between the countries of Zambia and Zimbabwe. While it is neither the highest nor the widest waterfall in the world, it is claimed to be the largest. This claim is based on a width of 1,708 m and height of 108 m, forming the largest sheet of falling water in the world. The falls' maximum flow rate compares well with that of other major waterfalls.</English>

Elles sont situées sur le fleuve Zambèze, qui constitue ?cet endroit la frontière entre la Zambie, ?proximit?de la ville de Livingstone, et le Zimbabwe. Le fleuve se jette dans la cataracte sur environ 1 700 mètres de largeur, et une hauteur qui peut atteindre un maximum de 108 mètres. Elles donnent un spectacle particulièrement remarquable, par leur disposition particulière - elles se jettent dans une longue faille du plateau, pour s'échapper par un étroit canyon. Elles peuvent ainsi être vues de face ?une distance d'une centaine de mètres seulement.</French>
