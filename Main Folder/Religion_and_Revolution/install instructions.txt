1) Like any other mod, copy Religion_and_Revolution (this folder) to your MODS folder.

The mod will already work with the 2 plot city radius WITHOUT any further changes. 

2) Install "1 plot city radius" feature:

In case you like the older 1 plot city radius version do the following:

Religion and Revolution 2.6 ONE CITY PLOT requires amending of one file before it works properly.

a) copy the file "CvGameCoreDLL.dll" from the folder "1 city plot" into the folder /mods/Religion_and_Revolution/Assets and overwrite the existing file.
b) Play and enjoy 1 plot city radius!

Note: Savegames aren't compatible between the two DLL files. Switching frequently will cause issues.

Multiplayer should work, though odd things will happen if people don't use the same DLL file.

For changing back to the 2 plot city radius please do the same step with the file in the folder "2 city plot"
