We the People Changelog

Version 2.7.1.1

Fixes:

- AI players no longer have free custom houses
- Natives now store production from more than one turn (related to the custom house issue)

Version 2.7.1

Improvements:
- #83 Clicking on the colony plot in the colony screen allows changing which yield to produce.
- #199 Double click a unit in garrison now brings up choose profession.

AI improvements:
- #17 automated coastal ships now pick routes as ships, like going between islands instead of competing against land transport.
- #171 Fixed a mistake that would have the AI consider the cities on its own team as being possible victims. Removed a cheat so that the AI has to have revealed the target city.

Fixes:
- #2 Native haggling exploit fixed: natives will no longer automatically accept haggles with replaced / added items.
- #23 typo: Priate Map fixed
- #26 Forts are upgraded by UNITCOMBAT_GUN or UNITCOMBAT_SIEGE, not just Colonial Militia.
- #26 Forts no longer upgrades from being worked on by a colony, only by placing military units on it.
- #40 Worldbuilder issue making very difficult to set diplomatic attitudes fixed.
- #51 Fixed case where AI could turn stone into lumber (copy paste error)
- #73 Shipwrecks no longer appear under ice.
- #77 Learn by Doing system is upgraded:
        - Now the chance of becoming an expert increases with time.
        - learn by doing chance is correctly adjusted with game speed.
        - The overall chance of a unit to become expert is significantly increased,
          specially for leaders with bonuses to the "chance of becoming expert through hard work".
        - Changing professions do not reset the Learn by doing count: if only makes the 
          possibility of an unit to become expert at that turn to be zero.
        - DOWNSIDE: units may become experts on professions they have recently changed into.
- #86 The Domestic Advisor: Native tab now allows sorting by the goods the indians want.
- #87 Hurry production fails if there isn't warehouse space.
- #96 The Domestic Advisor: native tab now shows natives that you have discovered, but not yet talked with.
- #156 1 plot colony radius allowed colonies to be placed too close, even next to each other in some cases.
- #164 Out of sync GameFont ids resulted in wrong mission icons in Domestic Advisor.
- #172 Remove meaningless assert checks. (Being short on money is completely legitimate and not an error :P)
- #178 CvPlot::updateWorkingCity() now updates cache for CvPlot::hasYield() if the city change.
- #190 Colonies used human player for culture spread threshold instead of colony owner. Spain has a discount.
- #190 Fixed network desync related to culture spread if a human player is Spain.
- Crash if a colonist is on land on the edge of the map (founding code didn't take map edge into account).
- Combat (game) freezes when defeating the last unit of a (European only?) player.
- Colony import all/auto export all buttons now works again (broke in RaR 2.6)

Graphics:
- #158 Reintroduced the pre 2.7 loading screen
- #174 Pick a random loading screen each time a screen is displayed (currently the list has just one file)

Changes affecting xml modders:
- Domestic Advisor can display GameFont characters when using a debug DLL.
- #92 Custom house overhaul, moving settings from DLL hardcoding to xml.

DLL modding changes:
- #54 xml missing & on a local reference to an xml info class will now cause a compile error. Crashes from this issue are time consuming to track down.
- #190 Added network sync logging/debugging tool to track down causes of OOS.

Bugfixes from RaR (after 2.7, not released in stable before, all made by WTP members)

- BUG27: Fixed the coastal ship teleport / chain capture bug (units were allowed to jump to enemy cities)
- BUG28: Adapted from K-mod. Fixed an issue in getBestDefender that could make the AI think that a unit inside a transport was a valid defender. Additional optimizations (by refactoring some of the functionality into a separate and more effective hasDefender()

- BUG30: The info screen demographics and graphs now only include the European players. The animals, church, kings and natives are excluded.

- BUG33: Ships that enter the map after returning from a port will no longer risk being placed on impassable terrain (e.g. ice)
- BUG34: Attempt to fix the issue where a wagon carrying sheep exceeded the import limit of the city, causing the excess to be taken to the  capital (which did not even import the yield in question)
- BUG35: From K-mod: "Fixed a group pathfinding bug in the original bts code"
- BUG35: We will no longer attempt to make peace with ourselves!
- BUG36: Imported several fixes from K-mod: (list of 7 items not included here)

- BUG37: Fix strange divide by zero bug in CvPlayerAI::AI_transferYieldValue. It's weird that this happened so I am adding an assert to help detect issues caused by variables unexpectedly having negative values!
- BUG38: Adapted from K-mod, alberts2, DarkLunaPhantom. Various fixes concerning "Typos, order of operations mistakes, memory leaks, missing initialisers, style changes."
- BUG40: Adapted from K-mod. Whenever we check the attitude towards our own team, we're always friendly :P
- BUG41: Adapted from K-mod \ Unofficial patch. CvUnit::healTurns and CvUnit::canHeal - Now handles damage and healing from plot features (thanks LunarMongoose)

- EXP4: To receive revolutionary support, we now require the player to be on good terms with the potential supporter's king as well
- EXP5: AI players fighting the revolutionary war will no longer consider a bribe to sign peace with their king. Also they will no longer reply with the "we'd love to, but you would have to ask them" nonsense :P
- GAME1: African slaves now have the same restrictions as native slaves with respect to allowed professions
- OPT3: From K-mod: "Made some minor efficiency improvements to CvUnitAI::AI_promote"
- OPT4: From K-mod: Disabled some obsolete BtS code.

- AI16: Block AI from producing YIELD_CANNON
- AI17: Restricting the UNITAIs considered by great generals / admirals

- AI19: By mistake I had broken CvPlayerAI::AI_needsProtection by omitting to return true when a transport needed protection.
- AI20: Added isProfessionalMilitary() mainly to prevent the AI from having units with GGs attached join cities.

- EVENTS3: The WHALING event is no longer recurrent since the event's logic cannot handle it correctly
