How do I install the mod ?

1) First make sure that your colonization game is patched to official patch 1.01f.
(Everything else will cause heavy problems.)

2) Go to the game directory. It's the one with Colonization.exe.

3) Create a folder called Mods if it's not already there.

4) Place the We The People folder inside Mods. Do not use the Mods folder in My Documents.

5) Copy the files from "Copy to Colonization.exe" and place them next to Colonization.exe.

Regarding mod name:
Multiplayer requires all players to call the mod the same thing.

Savegames can only be loaded using the same mod name as when they were saved. We can however change the mod name in a savegame.

Troubleshooting:
---------------------------
Failed Initializing Python
---------------------------
Python exceptions not enabled in ini file. This means the actual error is hidden.
Since CvGameCoreDLL.dll forces python errors to be displayed, we can assume that file isn't loaded.
See below on how to deal with that issue.

---------------------------
CvGameCoreDLL.dll not loaded
---------------------------
This is usually caused by one of two issues.
1: the file is missing.
  The file should be in Assets/CvGameCoreDLL.dll
  It should always be there in releases, through it needs to be compiled if you get the development version.
  Refer to documentation on compiling the dll for details on how to create a dll file yourself.
  
2: Missing libraries (3rd party dll files)
  CvGameCoreDLL.dll won't load if any of the dll files it tries to load are missing.
  Sadly due to a technical limitation the game will only look for them next to the exe file, not inside the mod.
  Do install step 5 (again) to get the dll files placed where they are supposed to be.
