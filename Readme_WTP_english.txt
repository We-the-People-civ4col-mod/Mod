Welcome to "We The People"!

Foreword
-------

"We The People" is the most extensive and complex mod for "Sid Meier's Civilization IV: Colonization" that you can find.
As a player, you must decide for yourself whether it is also the best. Just try out a few mods.

There is heart and soul and a lot of modding history in "We The People", as the next few paragraphs will show you.
It is not for nothing that a small but passionate team continuously improves and expands this mod with the help of the community.

Our origins:
-----------------

To avoid confusion, let's say straightaway that "We The People" (WTP for short) is the successful continuation of "Religion and Revolution" (simply RaR for short).
WTP continues the proud tradition of RaR with a new team. Among them are many old team members of RaR.

Therefore WTP still contains all the features of RaR, but is much bigger and even better.
That means more new features, nicer graphics, better AI, countless bug fixes, text corrections, balancing improvements, performance improvements ...


Old RaR veterans always recommend that instead of RaR you now play WTP.
Of course that's up to you, the players, and your preferences.

"Religion and Revolution" (RaR) - the predecessor of "We The People" - in its day was based on "The Authentic Colonization" (TAC) in version 2.03_final.
Without TAC, WTP would not exist today. Therefore, we also owe TAC eternal gratitude and corresponding credits.

So why the change of the project name?
-------------------------------------------

Well, most of the RaR team members finally decided that enough was enough. As with TAC, the core team became too small and the air was out.
The rest of the community and some former team members weren't ready for that. They decided not to give up on RaR as a mod.

The team composition, and also the mod philosophy, had changed so much that a new name was appropriate.
Over time one, another and then more of the old RaR team came back until there was a new team again.

Small conclusion:
--------------

We are proud to be part of the history of this community, so that after many successes and setbacks we still exist today.
We hope that our mod will continue as part of this community history for a while yet.

It's not possible to list every single supporter or modder to whom we owe thanks.
We will therefore concentrate on those to whom we owe the greatest thanks, now or in the past.

We hope you have fun playing our mod.

How do I install the mod?

First of all, make sure that your Colonization game uses the official patch 1.01.f.
(Other versions cause severe problems).

Note:
If you have the Steam version, you are automatically up to date and don't need to do anything.
(Only the old CD version needs to be updated).

Here's how to play "We The People" Mod, or Civ4Col Multiplayer games, without bugs.
Revert your Steam installation of Civ4Col to "Original Release version" - which is easily possible.
Go to your Steam client, and switch back to "Original Release Version" - even if Steam says it is "unsupported".
(Simply ignore that "unsupported". It has absolutely no implication. This is in fact the best version available on Steam.)

Install "We The People" like any other mod.
First, unpack the archive from the download link of the corresponding release (e.g. on GitHub).
Then copy the unzipped mod into the "Mods" folder of Colonization:
(e.g. C:\User\UserName\My Games\Colonization\MODS).

Use a Steam desktop icon to open "We The People". Generate the icon by right-clicking the game, going to "Manage" and then "Add Desktop Shortcut". Once you see the icon, right-click it, go to "Properties" and change the URL to   steam://rungameid/16810/Mod="WeThePeople-3.0.1"   or whatever release of the mod you're currently using.

The text between the quotes should match the name of your mod folder.

Once that's done, clicking your new icon will take you to the mod, passing through the Vanilla window along the way without launching it. Opening Vanilla and going from there to the mod can cause problems.

P.S.: Check the forum every now and then to see if there are new versions.

-------------------

What is this mod?

It is currently by far the largest CivCol mod in existence.
It’s our attempt to bring together many of the best ideas and concepts that the CivCol modding has created.

We have also tried to bring back some of the bigger features from the original Colonization, which for some reason were missing from CivCol.

But we didn't just throw it all together. Almost everything we put in has been tweaked and improved.
We’ve very carefully weighed which features to include and how to implement them.

We want to create a mod that offers more variety, more surprises and more challenge.
Little by little we’re trying to improve every single aspect of the game: economy, exploration, diplomacy, trade, events, wars...

Some aspects of the mod are meant to lean a little more towards complicated simulation, 
while others deliver more action.

But, while we do this, we always think about usability, AI, performance, historical authenticity; things to to think about.
Not everything is done yet.


-------------------

Is using our work allowed?

Yes, in general you can use our source code, our graphics, our images ...
But please remember to give proper credit. Ask if you’re not sure.

-------------------

Important remarks about distribution and rights of use:
"We The People" is a non-commercial mod project.

If you distribute "We The People", please pay attention to the copyright.
We allow use and distribution as long as "We The People" remains non-commercial.
Of course, you are allowed to use "We The People" in your own mod project, as long as there’s no copyright infringement and it’s a non-commercial project.
If you use "We The People" in a mod of your own, you must say so, and also point out changes to the original "We The People" mod.

-------------------

Can I support your work financially? 
No.
Many people have offered to donate money, but we can't accept money.
This project was only born out of joy and fun in modding.

-------------------

What are the plans for the future?

Please have a look at our forum.
That’s where we can keep game status and current  planning up to date.

-------------------

Is it possible to participate?

Yes, absolutely.
You can give feedback, report bugs, share ideas ...
We are also looking for new team members, partners and projects for collaborations. 

-------------------

A little advice:

When you play "We The People” for the first time, read the Colopedia and check out the forum.
Ask questions if you don't know something. The team and the community are helpful.

-------------------

Now it’s finally time to play the mod!
Have fun!

Your WTP Team
