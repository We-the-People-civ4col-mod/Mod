## Version History
##
## 1.08 - Translation into English language added. XML defined in "CIV4GameText_TAC".
## 
## 1.07 - Exchanged order of lattitude and landform options to bypass the quickstart bug. (by koma13)
##
## 1.06 - Translation revision: Deutsche Uebersetzung korrigiert (by Writing Bull)
##
## 1.05 - Added new option allowing you to limit upper and lower map borders to a specific lattitude.
## Increased chances for jungle (temperature and altitude). (by koma13)
##
## 1.04 - Fixed a copy and paste bug that overwrote changes the land percent.
## Also, made separate filters for temperature and altitude filters. This allows
## some better definition to the mountain ranges.
##
## 1.03 - Fixed a problem with mountain ranges forming between the map
## content edge and the water band added to ensure distance to Europe. Fixed
## a problem where light forest was placed on a lake.
##
## 1.02 - Maps really were too large so I shrank them and made them taller
## than they are wide. Added an option for distance to Europe. Added a
## land forms option for more or less islands.
##
## 1.01 - Fix for multiplayer
##
## 1.0 - Ta Daaa!
