// File to declare which enum values have to be available even in dynamic DLLs
//
// The problem solved here is that the enum values are freely available in hardcoded DLLs, but using them will make the dynamic DLL fail to compile.
// At compile time, any enum value mentioned here will be autogenerated as a global read only variable and set automatically while reading xml.
// This allows the enum variables to be used anywhere in the code just like it's hardcoded enums.
// Adding an enum here, which isn't in xml will cause an error message at startup. This will catch the case when the xml files are changed.
//
// This will not affect hardcoded DLL files as they still rely on the hardcoded enums, hence knowing the values at compile time.
//
// Note: since the compiler itself will not see this file, order doesn't matter and partial enums are allowed.
//       in fact it would be best to only include the enums, which are actually used in the code.
//
// Design consideration: in many cases it's bad design to mention explicit enum types as it can restrict what can be done in xml later.
//                       please consider if reading data from xml info classes could be a better solution as it grants more xml freedom.

// WARNING: only lines ending with a comma (,) will be used meaning even the last entry in an enum needs to end with a comma
